# Predicting Albedo of Moon Using Machine Learning

The Lunar Prospector was a NASA spacecraft that orbited the Moon for over 19 months to analyse its surface composition and search for polar ice. At both poles, the probe discovered indications of water ice. The mission came to a close when the spacecraft collided with the lunar surface, resulting in a dust cloud that was observed from Earth.

Form the chemical data collected by the Lunar Prospector, we find the relation between chemical composition and albedo of the moon which can help in predicting the un known data of chemical compostions of mercury with the help of already existing albedo data of mercury
